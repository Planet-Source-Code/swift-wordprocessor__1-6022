## Wordprocessor


</div>

### Description

Hey all --> This is the first beta of a wordprocessor called "SJOTS Perfect 5" I wrote...you can find the previous versions on my website, but this beta (well, it's more freeware) works pretty good. It can do almost anything with Rich Text Files (RTF). Please leave any comments how you think about it! :)
